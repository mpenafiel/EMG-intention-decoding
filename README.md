<h2>EMG Task Classification and Intention Detection</h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>
The goal of this project is to implement a system that leverages the [A Framework of Temporal-Spatial Descriptors-Based Feature Extraction proposed by Rami Kushabi](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7886279)
Collect and process raw emg data from the MindRove ARMband. Once the data has been processed it is fed into an artificial nueral network to create a model from the patients profile.
Once this is done, new emg data can be fed into the model to detect the intention of the patient based on the pose they are trying to create. The result drives the HoH to assist the
patient create the pose. This is a form of therapy to help the patient train movements that would otherwise be difficult for them to create by themselves.
