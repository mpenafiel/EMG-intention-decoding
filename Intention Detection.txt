Intention Detection

Initial data is collected on a new patient, which is then used to train a model. Once that model has been trained, it will be associated with the signature of the patient and should be saved with a name that reflects this for future sessions.

Data can be visualized in the Analysis Tab, which can be accessed at the top left of the window.

When collecting new data samples, DO NOT close the window, as this interrupts data collection.
