    The Intention Detection System is designed to collect, process, and evaluate EMG signals from the MindRove Armband. There are a total of 6 tasks that can be trained using the system. The first funtion collects data while the patient performs a series of tasks. The order in which they are performed may or may not be predetermined. At the start of the trial, a countdown begins to prepare the patient. The tasks will appear as an image that the patient should replicate, with the task name appearing in the top left corner, and the time until the next task in the top right corner. In between each task there is a resting period, where the patient can relax. Click the next button to familiarize the patient with each task.
